# Web Scraping and Financial Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping financial data from various sources and analyzing it using libraries like BeautifulSoup, pandas, and yfinance.

## Steps for Web Scraping:

1. **Identify Target Website**: Determine the website from which you want to extract data.

2. **Understand Website Structure**: Analyze the structure of the website, including the layout, HTML structure, and the location of the data you want to scrape.

3. **Choose a Tool**: Select a suitable tool or library for web scraping. Popular choices include BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.

4. **Retrieve HTML Content**: Use an HTTP library like Requests to send a GET request to the website and retrieve the HTML content.

5. **Parse HTML**: Use the chosen scraping library (e.g., BeautifulSoup) to parse the HTML content and extract the desired data.

6. **Extract Data**: Identify the HTML elements containing the data you want to scrape and extract the relevant information.

7. **Process and Store Data**: Process the extracted data as needed (e.g., clean, transform) and store it in an appropriate format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database.

8. **Handle Errors and Exceptions**: Implement error handling to deal with potential issues, such as network errors, missing data, or changes in website structure.

9. **Test and Iterate**: Test your scraping code with different scenarios and iterate as needed to ensure it retrieves accurate and up-to-date data.

## Tools Used in the Provided Code:

- **Requests**: Python library used to send HTTP requests and retrieve HTML content from web pages.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides convenient methods for navigating and extracting data from HTML content.
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It's commonly used to work with tabular data, such as CSV files or DataFrames.
- **yfinance**: Python library for fetching financial data from Yahoo Finance. It provides an interface to access stock prices, company information, dividends, options, and more.

## Explanation of Code:

The provided code snippets demonstrate how to retrieve various types of information related to a specific company (in this case, Canoo, with the ticker symbol GOEV) using web scraping techniques and the yfinance library. Here's a brief overview of each snippet:

- **fetch_company_info Function**: This function fetches general information about a company using its ticker symbol. It utilizes the yfinance library to retrieve company information and returns a dictionary containing details such as company name, sector, market cap, etc.

- **save_to_csv Function**: This function takes data (presumably retrieved using the fetch_company_info function) and saves it to a CSV file. It uses the Pandas library to convert the data into a DataFrame and then writes it to a CSV file.

- **fetch_company_stock_history Function**: This function retrieves the historical stock price data for a company within a specified date range. It utilizes the yfinance library to fetch the stock history data and returns a DataFrame containing information such as date, open, high, low, close, volume, etc.

- **get_dividend_info Function**: This function fetches dividend information for a given company using its ticker symbol. It utilizes the yfinance library to retrieve dividend data and returns a pandas Series containing dividend amounts and dates.

- **get_options_chain Function**: This function retrieves options chain data for a given company and expiration date. It utilizes the yfinance library to fetch options data and returns a dictionary containing information about call and put options for the specified expiration date.

These functions demonstrate how to use web scraping techniques and the yfinance library to gather various types of financial information about a company from sources like Yahoo Finance.
